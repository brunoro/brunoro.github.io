Title: Hello from Emacsland
Tags: emacs, text editor

This is my first post from the Emacs (+ Markdown mode) side of the world. Muscle memory still
tricks me many times with :wq and :%s lapses, but I must say: it feels good.
The Finger yoga can be quite tricky when coming from the distinct vi-style editing
logic.

I'm still setting up my environment (including getting wombat instead of this bizarre colorscheme), 
but my main concern now is grasp this distinct buffer mobility. 
This [hyperpolyglot.org page on text editors](http://hyperpolyglot.org/text-mode-editors) has shown
itself amazingly useful.

I'll draft a new post when I get to show off one of those
[amazing emacs tricks](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQAd41VAXWo).
