Title: Debugging and Inspecting Elixir on Summer of Code 2013!
Tags: gsoc2013, elixir

Just a really quick update with great news: the project I pitched to [BEAM Community](http://beamcommunity.github.com/) 
was accepcted on [Google Summer of Code 2013](google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2013)! 
This means that until 15 September I'll be quite busy developing code inspection tools and a basic 
CLI debugger functionality for the great [Elixir](http://www.elixir-lang.org) language.

Also, this blog see some love at least for the next weeks, as I'll post weekly reports on the state of the project here (:
