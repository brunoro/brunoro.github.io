Title: I'm giving emacs a shot
Tags: emacs, text editor

Since the beggining of my adventures on the Lisp side of the universe with Clojure and Scheme,
I've seen a lot of tutorials made by developers with seemly ninja skills on emacs doing some
magical text editing (for instance [this one from Sam Aaron](http://vimeo.com/22798433)).
But after seeing a live showcase of the emacs possibilities for LaTeX editing, similar to 
[this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJgOWxwrEMw), I really got motivated to give emacs
a fresh try.

So, I'm starting to learn the emacs-fu and finger yoga in order to get to reproduce that workflow
at least for my Clojure and LaTex needs. Initally I'll try not to use any vim-like solution for emacs
such as [Viper](http://emacswiki.org/emacs/ViperMode) and [Evil](http://emacswiki.org/emacs/Evil).
My goal is to have some strong emacsy editing skills in order to compare the achievable productivity of both.

I have to say that the emacs community seems much more aware of the capabilities of the tool. It is
still kept like a hidden treasure under the siege of a Lisp dialect.
