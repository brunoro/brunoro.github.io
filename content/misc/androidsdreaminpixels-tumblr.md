Title: Do Androids Dream In Pixels?
Tags: glitch, art, machine learning, computer vision

So, almost 2 years since my last post, I finally have something worth sharing on machine burning again.
I'm starting a new project: [Do Androids Dream In Pixels?](http://androidsdreaminpixels.tumblr.com)

The idea is posting some experiments I've been doing with digital art, mostly glitches and neural networks.
Check it out!
