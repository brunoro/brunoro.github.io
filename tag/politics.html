The speed and volume of information in the current distorts our mental model of the world. We realize more than ever that our society exists on top of a narrative that doesn't need substance or truth to exist. We have more data and less knowledge. <a href="http://www.markborkowski.co.uk/hypernormal-pr-in-a-post-truth-world/">Everything is PR</a>.</p>

<p>This disconnection between what we experience and what we are fed through mass media make our contemporary democracies act in barely surrreal ways. 
I compiled with the help with some friends in social media a small list of learnings from our very own 2016, the year of the monkey:</p>
<ul>
<li>A democratically elected president can be taken down by a dubious conspiracy made by it's own (and very shady) political allies without proper trial, with the support of a big part of the population in name of some moral crusade against corruption.</li>
<li>A country can decide to ditch a deal that puts it on a very privileged position in the world, with the support of the part of the population that benefits the most from this same deal.</li>
<li>A 4 year peace negotiation to solve an ongoing 60 year civil war can be thrown in the dumpster, with the support of the population most affected by the conflict.</li>
<li>A presidential candidate riding piggyback on the political establishment, leading on most polls and considered the <em>sound</em> option can lose the elections to a inexperienced, incoherent and borderline perverse candidate, with the support of a silent majority that would be the most punished by the measures proposed by this winning candidate.</li>
<li>A supposedly democratically elected present can be just a fa√ßade for a semi-mystical secret society led by the president's counsellor, who has been its mentor since childhood.</li>
<li>A president with vast popular support staged a fake coup to dismantle the opposition and reinforce grip in the country's institutions. All the while being backed by the western powers, which see this country as a strategic partner in a key and largely destabilized region.</li>
