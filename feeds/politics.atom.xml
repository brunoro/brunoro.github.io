The speed and volume of information in the current distorts our mental model of the world. We realize more than never that our society seems to exist on top of a narrative that doesn't need substance or truth to exist. We have more data and less knowledge. &lt;a href="http://www.markborkowski.co.uk/hypernormal-pr-in-a-post-truth-world/"&gt;Everything is PR&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This disconnection between what we experience and what we are fed through mass media make our contemporary democracies act in barely surrreal ways. 
I compiled with the help with some friends in social media a small list of learnings from our very own 2016, the year of the monkey:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A democratically elected president can be taken down by a dubious conspiracy made by it's own (and very shady) political allies without proper trial, with the support of a big part of the population in name of some moral crusade against corruption.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A country can decide to ditch a deal that puts it on a very privileged position in the world, with the support of the part of the population that benefits the most from this same deal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A 4 year peace negotiation to solve an ongoing 60 year civil war can be thrown in the dumpster, with the support of the population most affected by the conflict.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A presidential candidate riding piggyback on the political establishment, leading on most polls and considered the &lt;em&gt;sound&lt;/em&gt; option can lose the elections to a inexperienced, incoherent and borderline perverse candidate, with the support of a silent majority that would be the most punished by the measures proposed by this winning candidate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A supposedly democratically elected present can be just a fa√ßade for a semi-mystical secret society led by the president's counsellor, who has been its mentor since childhood.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A president with vast popular support staged a fake coup to dismantle the opposition and reinforce grip in the country's institutions. All the while being backed by the western powers, which see this country as a strategic partner in a key and largely destabilized region.&lt;/li&gt;
